# Lumberjack
A framework for making WordPress theme development more sane & easier to maintain.

The framework has been designed to be as un-intrusive as possible and you're free to use as little or as much of it as you'd like.

Written & maintained by the team at [Rareloop](https://www.rareloop.com).

## Requirements
- PHP >=7.0
- Installation via Composer (e.g. Bedrock)

## Installing
This repository is a starter theme. To get started you should **download this and add it to your `themes/` directory**.

_(Note: Currently using a child-theme to extend this theme is unsupported.)_

The theme depends on the core Lumberjack framework. Install this via composer, like so:

```shell
composer require rareloop/lumberjack-core
```

## Configuration

Lumberjack comes with a selection of config files out-of-the-box. These live in the `config/` directory and are simple `.php` files that return an `array`.

### Accessing Configuration Values

Let's take a look at `config/app.php`:

```php
return [
    /**
     * The current application environment
     */
    'environment' => getenv('WP_ENV'),

    // ...etc
];
```

Here we are proxying an environment variable defined in the `.env` file that Bedrock provides. We'd recommend following this pattern, where you should only see `getenv` called in your config files.

You can easily access the environment variable using the `Rareloop\Lumberjack\Facades\Config` facade.

```php
use Rareloop\Lumberjack\Facades\Config;

$env = Config::get('app.environment');
```

You can provide a default value too, incase the configuration option does not exist.

```php
$env = Config::get('app.environment', 'production');
```

If you need to update a config option, you can use the `set` method, like so:

```php
Config::set('app.debug', false);
```

### Adding your own config files

Chances are, you're going to need to add your own config files at some point. All you need to do is create a new `.php` file in the `config/` directory, and have it return an array.

This works because Lumberjack will look for all files in the `config/` directory that have a `.php` extention and automatically registers all the data to the application's config.

## Post Types

Typically in WordPress when you're querying posts you get [`WP_Post`](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Post) objects back. Timber have taken this a step further and return a `Timber/Post` object instead. This [has a ton of great helper methods and properties](https://timber.github.io/docs/reference/timber-post/) which makes it easier and more expressive to use.

```php
use Timber\Post;

$post = new Post(1);
$posts = Timber::get_posts($wpQueryArray);
```

Lumberjack has its own Post object which makes it easier and more expressive to run queries.

```php
use Rareloop\Lumberjack\Post;

$post = new Post(1);
$collection = Post::query($wpQueryArray);
```

This becomes especially powerful when you start registering **Custom Post Types**.


```php
use App\PostTypes\Product;

$post = new Product(1);
$collection = Product::query($wpQueryArray);
```

In this example `$collection` contains `App\PostType\Product` objects. That allows you to add your own methods to a product and encapsulate logic in one place.

```php
use App\PostTypes\Product;

$collection = Product::query($wpQueryArray);

foreach ($collection as $product) {
    echo $product->price();
}
```

```php
namespace App\PostTypes;

use Rareloop\Lumberjack\Post;

class Product extends Post
{
    // ...

    public function price()
    {
        // Get the price from the ACF field for this product
        return get_field('price', $this->id);
    }
}
```

### Register Custom Post Types

First, create a new file in `app/PostTypes/`. We recommend using singular names. For this example, lets add a `Product.php` file there.

You can use this boilerplate to get you started:

```php
namespace App\PostTypes;

use Rareloop\Lumberjack\Post;
use Rareloop\Lumberjack\QueryBuilder\Post as QueryBuilderPost;

class Product extends Post
{
    /**
     * Return the key used to register the post type with WordPress
     * First parameter of the `register_post_type` function:
     * https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_post_type
     *
     * @return string
     */
    public static function getPostType()
    {
        return 'products';
    }

    /**
     * Return the config to use to register the post type with WordPress
     * Second parameter of the `register_post_type` function:
     * https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_post_type
     *
     * @return array|null
     */
    protected static function getPostTypeConfig()
    {
        return [
            'labels' => [
                'name' => __('Products'),
                'singular_name' => __('Product'),
                'add_new_item' => __('Add New Product'),
            ],
        ];
    }
}
```

Lumberjack will handle the registering of the post type for you. In order to do that, it requires 2 methods (documented above):

- `getPostType()`
- `getPostTypeConfig()`

In order for Lumberjack to register your post type, you need to add the class name to the `config/posttypes.php` config file.

```php
return [
    /**
     * List all the sub-classes of Rareloop\Lumberjack\Post in your app that you wish to
     * automatically register with WordPress as part of the bootstrap process.
     */
    'register' => [
        App\PostTypes\Product::class,
    ],
];
```

And that's it! You can now start using your new Custom Post Type.

#### Tip:

Try and avoid using ACF's `get_field` outside of a Post Type class. This will help make your application easy to change.

```php
$product = new Product;

// Bad
echo get_field('price', $product->id);

// Good: The knowledge of how to get the price is encapsulated within the Product class
echo $product->price();
```

### Available Methods for `Rareloop\Lumberjack\Post`

Lumberjack's `Post` class extends `Timber\Post`, and adds some convenient methods for you:

```php
use Rareloop\Lumberjack\Post;
use Rareloop\Lumberjack\Product;

// Get all published posts, ordered by ascending title
$posts = Post::all(10, 'title', 'asc');

// Accepts the WP_Query args as an array. By default it will filter by published posts for the correct post type too
$products = Product::query(['s' => 'Toy Car']);
```

## WordPress Controllers

In the files (i.e. controllers) that WordPress uses when it matches a route (e.g. `page.php`, `single.php`), you can now use a class rather than writing procedural code.

```php
// page-home.php

/*
 * Template Name: Home Template
 */

namespace App;

use Timber\Timber;
use Rareloop\Lumberjack\Post;
use App\Http\Responses\TimberResponse;

class PageHomeController
{
    public function handle()
    {
        $context = Timber::get_context();

        $context['post'] = new Post;

        return new TimberResponse('home', $context);
    }
}
```

**The name of the controller is important:**

- It should be under the namespace `App`.
- The class name must be an UpperCamelCase version of the filename with the word `Controller` on the end (without spaces, dashes and underscores). If the controller name is not correctly Lumberjack will not throw any errors - instead you will just get a blank page.

The `handle` method will automatically be called on your controller.

### Changing the naming convention

If you wish to change how Lumberjack looks for controller class names, you can hook into the `lumberjack_controller_name` filter.

```php
add_filter('lumberjack_controller_name', function ($controllerName) {
    // e.g. Look for 'HomeController' instead of 'PageHomeController'
    return str_replace('Page', '', $controllerName);
});
```

Or if you wish to change the namespace you can use the `lumberjack_controller_namespace` filter.

```php
add_filter('lumberjack_controller_namespace', function ($controllerName) {
    // e.g. Look for 'MyApp\PageHomeController' instead of 'App\PageHomeController'
    return 'MyApp\\'
});
```

### Controller for the 404 page

In WordPress, you have a `404.php` file. `PHP` Classes cannot start with a number so following the usual naming convention will not work here.

Instead Lumberjack will look for a controller called `Error404Controller`

## Router

The Lumberjack Router is based on the standalone [Rareloop Router](https://github.com/Rareloop/router) but utilised a Facade to make setup and access simpler.

Sometimes you want to create a page on your website but do not want it editable in WordPress. That's when this router comes into play. It can also be used to make AJAX enpoints.

If you set up a custom route that has the same URL as a WordPress page, the router takes priority.

Note: Route closures and controller functions are automatically dependency injected from the container.

### Creating Routes

Typically, you only need to allow one HTTP verb for a route (e.g. `POST` or `GET`). To create a route, use the HTTP verb as the method name. The first parameter is the URI and the second is the code you wish to execute when that route is matched.

```php
Router::get('test/route', function () {});
Router::post('test/route', function () {});
Router::put('test/route', function () {});
Router::patch('test/route', function () {});
Router::delete('test/route', function () {});
Router::options('test/route', function () {});
```

#### Route Parameters
Parameters can be defined on routes using the `{keyName}` syntax. When a route matches that contains parameters, an instance of the `RouteParams` object is passed to the action.

```php
Router::get('posts/{id}', function(RouteParams $params) {
    return $params->id;
});
```

#### Named Routes
Routes can be named so that their URL can be generated programatically:

```php
Router::get('posts/all', function () {})->name('posts.index');

$url = Router::url('posts.index');
```

If the route requires parameters you can be pass an associative array as a second parameter:

```php
Router::get('posts/{id}', function () {})->name('posts.show');

$url = Router::url('posts.show', ['id' => 123]);
```

### Creating Groups
It is common to group similar routes behind a common prefix. This can be achieved using Route Groups:

```php
Router::group('prefix', function ($group) {
    $group->get('route1', function () {}); // `/prefix/route1`
    $group->get('route2', function () {}); // `/prefix/route2`
});
```

### Route Controllers
If you'd rather use a class to group related route actions together you can pass a Controller String instead of a closure.

The string takes the format `{name of class}@{name of method}`. It is important that you use the complete namespace with the class name.

```php
// app/Http/Controllers/TestController.php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

class TestController
{
    public function show()
    {
        return 'Hello World';
    }
}

// routes.php
Router::get('route/uri', '\App\Http\Controllers@show');
```

#### Map

If you need match a URL for multiple HTTP methods, you can use the `map` method and pass in an array of HTTP methods to match.

```php
use Rareloop\Lumberjack\Facades\Router;

// Creates a route that matches the uri `/posts/list` both GET
// and POST requests.
Router::map(['GET', 'POST'], 'posts/list', function () {
    return 'Hello World';
});
```

`map()` takes 3 parameters:

- `methods` (array): list of matching HTTP methods, valid values:
    + `GET`
    + `POST`
    + `PUT`
    + `PATCH`
    + `DELETE`
    + `OPTIONS`
- `uri` (string): The URI to match against
- `action`  (function|string): Either a closure or a Controller string

## HTTP Request/Response Messages

_TODO: Request documentation. If you'd like to know more about this, please add an issue._

All of your WordPress and Router controllers should return PSR7 compliant response. The most common use-case is rendering a `twig` view and passing in some context. Using Timber it would look like this:

```php
use Timber\Timber;

return Timber::render('home', $context);
```

In Lumberjack, you should take advantage of the `Rareloop\Lumberjack\Http\Responses\TimberResponse` object to achieve the same thing:

```php
use Rareloop\Lumberjack\Http\Responses\TimberResponse;

return new TimberResponse('home', $context);
```

The benefit to using these reponses is that they let you controll the HTTP status code & headers.

```php
use Zend\Diactoros\Response\JsonResponse;

return new JsonResponse($data, 422, ['X-Total-Validation-Errors' => 2]);
```

Or if you prefer, you can use the `withStatus` and `withHeader` methods instead.

```php
use Zend\Diactoros\Response\JsonResponse;

return (new JsonResponse($data, 422))
    ->withStatus(422)
    ->withHeader('X-Total-Validation-Errors', 2);
```

### Available Responses

As we make use of a great 3rd party package: [Zend Diactoros](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros), Lumberjack includes an array of handy responses out-of-the-box.

```php
$response = new Rareloop\Lumberjack\Http\Responses\TimberResponse('home', $context);

// Check out their documentation for further details and examples:
// https://zendframework.github.io/zend-diactoros/
$response = new Zend\Diactoros\Response\TextResponse('Hello world!');
$response = new Zend\Diactoros\Response\HtmlResponse($htmlContent);
$response = new Zend\Diactoros\Response\XmlResponse($xml);
$response = new Zend\Diactoros\Response\JsonResponse($data);
$response = new Zend\Diactoros\Response\EmptyResponse(); // Basic 204 response:
$response = new Zend\Diactoros\Response\RedirectResponse('/user/login');
```

## Dependency Injection Container
Lumberjack features a PSR11 compatible container, powered by the popular open source [PHPDI](http://php-di.org). If this is a new term for you checkout this [great intro](http://php-di.org/doc/understanding-di.html) and don't worry, you don't have to make use of it if you don't want to.

#### Accessing the container
In the default Lumberjack `functions.php` you'll find the following code:

```php
$app = new Application(__DIR__);
```

This creates the Application and the `$app` variable becomes your reference to the container.

### Setting entries in the container
To add something to the container you simply call `bind()`, e.g.:

```php
$app->bind('foo', 'bar');
```

### Retrieving entries from the container
To retrieve an entry from the container you can use `get()`, e.g.:

```php
$foo = $app->get('foo');
```

### Use the container to create an object
You can use the container to create an object from any class that your application can autoload using `make()`, e.g.:

```php
$comment = $app->make('\MyNamespace\Comment');
```

When creating an object using `make`, all the dependencies required by it's `__construct()` function will be automatically resolved from the container using type hinting. If your object requires additional parameters that can not resolved by type hinting you can pass them as a second param, e.g.:

```php
namespace MyNamespace;

class Comment
{
  public function __construct(ClassInContainer $resolvable, $param1, $param2) {}
}

...

$comment = $app->make('\MyNamespace\Comment', [
  'param1' => 123,
  'param2' => 'abc',
]);
```

### Set concrete implementations for interfaces
You can also tell the container what concrete class to use when resolving a certain type hinted interface. This allows you to write your app code against contracts and then use the container to switch in the correct implementation at runtime.

```php
namespace MyNamespace;

interface PaymentGateway {}

class StripePaymentGateway implements PaymentGateway{}

$app->set('\MyNamespace\PaymentGateway', '\MyNamespace\StripePaymentGateway');

$gateway = $app->make('\MyNamespace\PaymentGateway');
// $gateway is instance of '\MyNamespace\StripePaymentGateway'
```

## Service Providers
_TODO: If you'd like to know more about this, please add an issue_

## Facades
Lumberjack uses the [Blast Facades](https://github.com/phpthinktank/blast-facades) library.

### Creating a Facade
Facades provide a simple static API to an object that has been registered into the container. For example to setup a facade you would first use a Service Provider to register an instance of your class into the container:

```php
namespace Rareloop\Lumberjack\Providers;

use Monolog\Logger;
use Rareloop\Lumberjack\Application;

class LogServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function register()
    {
        // Create object instance and bind into container
        $this->app->bind('logger', new Logger('app'));
    }
}
```

Then create a Facade subclass and tell it which key to use to retrieve your class instance:

```php
namespace Rareloop\Lumberjack\Facades;

use Blast\Facades\AbstractFacade;

class Log extends AbstractFacade
{
    protected static function accessor()
    {
        return 'logger';
    }
}
```
