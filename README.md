# Supercharge your WordPress Development

Lumberjack is a powerful MVC framework for the modern WordPress developer. Write better, more expressive and easier to maintain code.

## Who is Lumberjack for?

Coming from another PHP framework such as Laravel, have experience using Timber with WordPress but want more, or are just getting started with modern WordPress? Then Lumberjack is for you.

Use as little or as much as you need, it's beginner friendly!

## Documentation

The Lumberjack documentation can be found here:

[https://docs.lumberjack.rareloop.com](https://docs.lumberjack.rareloop.com)

For more information, check out the website:

[https://lumberjack.rareloop.com](https://lumberjack.rareloop.com)

*Note: This repository is just the starter theme used for the project and doesn't require updating very often. The majority of the development work, and where progress can be seen if you're interested, is in the [framework repository](https://github.com/Rareloop/lumberjack-core)*

## Getting Started

See the documentation for details on how to get started: [https://docs.lumberjack.rareloop.com/getting-started/installation](https://docs.lumberjack.rareloop.com/getting-started/installation)

## Built on strong foundations

Standing on the shoulders of giants, Lumberjack proudly builds on the great work of other open source WordPress projects.

- [Timber](https://timber.github.io/docs/)

## Beautiful code. Easy to maintain

Object orientated and MVC patterns help keep your code structured and DRY.

**index.php**

```php
class IndexController
{
    public function handle()
    {
        $context = Timber::get_context();
        $context['posts'] = Post::whereStatus('publish')
            ->limit(5)
            ->get();

        return new TimberResponse('index.twig', $context);
    }
}
```

**index.twig**

```html
{% if posts is not empty %}
    <h4>Recent Articles</h4>
    <ul>
        {% for post in posts %}
            <li class="article">
                <h3>{{ $post->title }}</h3>
                {{ $post->preview }}
                <a href="{{ $post->link }}">Read the full story</a>
            </li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
{% endif %}
```

Lumberjack is available under the [MIT license](https://github.com/Rareloop/lumberjack/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) and you're free to use it for personal or commercial projects.

**If you've recieved value from Lumberjack we'd hugely appreciate it if you could donate to our [Ecologi forest](https://ecologi.com/rareloop?r=60618d1bcdd7a4001d7b86f2) and help us plant real life trees to combat the climate crisis. Compared to the cost of developing a framework like Lumberjack, a few trees per project is a bargain and makes a positive difference to the environment.**
